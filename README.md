# Computer-Vision
Materials for computer vision course using the duckie-sky platform
Created by Matthew Stein of Roger Williams University for ENGR430
Computer Vision.  This course was intended for senior electrical 
engineering students and sophomore and above level computer science
students.

Besides building the duckie-drone students will learn the python programming
language and use it to write enrty-level computer vision algorithms.  Exercises
will include manipulating pixels directly, writing filters, building an Canny
edge detector from scratch, building a Hough line detector from scratch and
using the Open CV built-in ORB and Knn matcher to locate the drone above a
known map.
